We will be writing code for our web application scanner tool. 
Your Job is to write simple code for each scanner. 
The code should be as following:

- Simple code 
- Easy to understand
- Functional Programming
- Proper Short Comments 



Each script should have proper but not too many logging statements to show progress of the scanner.

Example :

Use [!] for errors 
Use [~] for successful results
Use [*] for warnings
